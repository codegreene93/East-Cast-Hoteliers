        <h3>Spa Room Renovation </h3>
        <p class="button">Before ECH came we weren't maximising our gyms potential. Our spa was in desperate need for imporvements. ECH's input was invaluable to us and has dramatically increased footfall into our newly renovated spa.</p><br>

        <div class="Swimming">
        <h2>Wexford project</h2>
        <img src="project6.jpg" alt="Swimming pool"/>
        <h3>Swimming Pool Renovation </h3>
        <p class="button">Our Swimming pool was past it's prime. ECH helped us work the space that we have and encouraged us to use the pool during off peak times for swimming lessons. Now we have another revenue stream coming into business helping us remain profitable.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="kitchen">
        <h2>Dublin project</h2>
        <img src="kitchen.jpg" alt="Industrial Kitchen"/>
        <h3>Kitchen Renovation </h3>
        <p class="button">We decided to renovate our restaurant into a fine dining restaurant. With this came a more dynamic and challengine menu that our kitchen just wasn't equipped for. ECH helped us come up with a syplistic and eloquent menu which allowed us to reduce our food costs while increasing our menu prices.</p><br>

      <div class="column2">
      <div class="floor">
      <h2>Kilkenny project</h2>
      <img src="floor.jpg" alt="Empty floor"/>
      <h3>Floor Renovation </h3>
      <p class="button">We had a lot of space but we just weren't taking advantage of the available seating in the room. ECH helped us redo our floor plan. We added 20 extra seats. This increased our RevPASH by 18%.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="garden">
      <h2>Kildare project</h2>
      <img src="Garden.jpg" alt="garden"/>
      <h3>Garden Renovation </h3>
      <p class="button">While doing a floor walk with ECH they stopped us and asked us how many weddings per annum we were having in our garden. Our response "0". We conducted 3 weddings this summer using Marquee just incase it rains. ECH showed us every square inch of your property is an opportunity to capatilise your revenue.</p><br>

      <h2>Dublin project</h2>

      <h3>Capitalising Revenue Management</h3>
      <p class="button">We operated seasonal rates so our prices were fixed. No matter how high or how low occupancy was in the city our prices remained the same. ECH helpes us set up IDeaS a Revenue Management system. Through it's implementation for the first time our rates were competitive. My most important take away point was "If you don't sell a room that night, you'll never get the opportunity to sell it ever again. Rooms are a perishable commodity." </p>
